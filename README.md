# 🌍 Interactive Orrery Web App - Inner Solar System 🌌

This project is part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge** under the **Orrery Web Challenge** category. It is a web-based interactive 3D simulation of the **Inner Solar System**, showcasing the orbits of planets, near-Earth comets (NECs), and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) using real NASA data. The project is built with **JavaScript** and **Three.js** for 3D graphics, with data sourced from various NASA open APIs.

### 🚀 Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Orbital Simulation**: Visualize the positions of planets and small bodies in the inner solar system using Keplerian parameters.
2. **Planetary Textures**: Each planet is rendered as a textured 3D sphere, with high-resolution maps from NASA.
3. **Interactive Controls**: Users can zoom, rotate, and explore the solar system in 3D space.
4. **Asteroid and Comet Data**: Integration of NASA's small-body databases, highlighting the orbits of near-Earth objects (NEOs) and comets.
5. **Educational Tooltips**: Hover over planets and objects to view detailed information such as orbital parameters, distances, and more.
6. **Time-Lapse Feature**: Users can simulate and observe planetary motion over time to study orbital dynamics.

### 🌐 Data Sources:
- **NASA Approximate Positions of the Planets**: Formulae and parameters for accurate planetary positioning.
- **Small-Body Database Query**: Keplerian parameters for near-Earth objects, including potentially hazardous asteroids.
- **NASA Open Data - Orbital Elements API**: Orbital parameters for near-Earth comets.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web development languages for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **Three.js**: A powerful 3D graphics library used for rendering the solar system and objects.
- **NASA Open APIs**: Real-time data fetching for orbital elements and other parameters.

### 📦 How to Use:
1. **Clone the repository**:
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**.
3. Explore the inner solar system, view planetary orbits, and interact with 3D models of planets and near-Earth objects.

### 🚧 Future Enhancements:
- Expand the orrery to include all planets in the solar system.
- Add more layers of data, such as spacecraft orbits and historical comet trajectories.
- Implement enhanced visualization options like Earth at night or custom planetary views.
